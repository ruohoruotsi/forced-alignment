# Forced alignment based on speech pauses using an RNN
This repository contains the code for my IP8 project at [FHNW](http://www.fhnw.ch).

## Getting started
The code was written for [Python](https://www.python.org/) `3.6.4` using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) `4.4.11`. You will need the Python packages listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

This application uses [Pydub](http://pydub.com/) which means you will need **libav** or **ffmpeg** on your `PATH`. See the [Pydub Repository](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#installation) for further instructions.
