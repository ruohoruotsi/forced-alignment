    "# Corpus creation\n",
    "This IPython notebook documents the creation of the corpora from raw data. The corpora can also be created interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning task in the field of _Natural Language Processing (NLP)_ often rely on corpora. The ASR-stage in this project is no exception. Raw data is available from manifold sources. For this project, two sources (_ReadyLingua_ and _LibriSpeech_) were considered. However, other sources are conceivable. The final solution should be able to train on data from arbitrary resources. However, since properties and format of the raw data is usually not standardized between sources, some pre-processing is required in order to bring raw data into a format that can be used by the final system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each data source makes its own assumptions about how data should be represented, a separate preprocessing step is required for each data source. The processed data is then stored in _corpora_, which contain the actual data (audio signals and transcripts) as well as metadata (audio segmentation information, audio length, sampling rate, language, speaker gender, etc...). The data from the sources used in this project comes from different distributions (e.g. number of languages, speaker per gender, etc.). Therefore the processed data has been stored in different corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This project was built using Python 3.6 and Anaconda 3. Please install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Additionally, you need the following tools and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [FFMPEG](http://www.ffmpeg.org/): for the conversion and/or resampling of audio files\n",
    "* _ReadyLingua_ raw data: The aligned data from _ReadyLingua_ is not public domain. You need to get permission of the owner and store them on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other data is publicly available and will be downloaded as needed by this notebook."

    "\n",
    "Data from the LibriSpeech is available under the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) license. You can download the files yourself and specify an absolute path to folder where the files are stored. If the directory is empty, LibriSpeech data will automatically be downloaded and extracted there. If the directory is not empty, it is assumed that the data from LibriSpeech was already manually downloaded and extracted in this directory. In this case the directory structure must match the expected structure."

    "The _LibriSpeech_ raw data is split into training-, dev- and test-set (`train-*.tar.gz`, `dev-*.tar.gz` and `test-*.tar.gz`). However, those sets only contain the transcript as a set of segments and an audio file for each segment. They do not contain any temporal information which is needed for alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is also the `original-mp3-tar.gz` for download which contains the original LibriVox mp3 files (from which the corpus was created) along with the alignment information. Alignment is made on utterance-level, i.e. the transcript is split up into segments whereas each segment corresponds to an utterance. Segments were derived by allowing splitting on every silence interval longer than 300ms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is organized into subdirectories of the following path format:\n",

    "    ./LibriSpeech/mp3/{speaker_id}/{chapter_id}/\n",

    "- **Transcription file** `{speaker_id}-{chapter_id}.trans.txt`: Text file containing the transcriptions of the segments (one segment per line). Each line is prefixed with the transcription ID. The transcription is all uppercase and does not contain any punctuation.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Missing speech segments\n",
    "The original idea was to treat the aligned utterances as speech segments and the gaps between them as pause segments. Unfortunately it turned out that only part of the original text was aligned. As a result, the segmentation file contained some \"gaps\" between aligned audio, which corresponded to utterances of text passages which were then being falsely treated as pauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect whether an assumed pause segment was acutally a speech segment the speech segments before and after had to be examined and compared with the original passage from the book. If the original passage from the book contained text between the transcript for the speech segments, the pause segment was converted to a speech segment. Since no alignment information is available for this missing speech segment, this leads to three subsequent speech segments, i.e. there are no pause segments in between. To compare aligned text from the segmentation file with the original passage from the book, all text was normalized (uppercase, removal of non-ASCII characters, removal of punctuation)."
