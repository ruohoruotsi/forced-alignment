    "The RNN will be trained on spectrograms of the audio data from the created corpora. Since this process is computationally expensive and requires a lot of time. To speed up the iterations when training the RNN and get feedback faster, the input data (the spectrograms) are pre-computed and stored on disk. Also, the labels (the information about speech pauses) need to be encoded in a suitable format. This notebook describes how this is done.\n",

Since the corpora were create from different sources of raw data, they vary in size and probability distribution (number of languages, homogeneity of the recording quality, ratio of male vs. female speakers, presence of distortions like reverb or overdrive, and many more). Since the starting point for the creation of the corpus was so variable, different approaches were taken to split the corpus up into train-, dev- and test-set.\n",

Since the corpus is rather small there may be only one sample for a specific feature value (e.g. only one recording with reverb). Therefore to keep things simple the split into train-, dev- and test-set was done with a 80/10/10-rule without closer examination of the underlying data. This might not result in an optimal split since it would be possible for example that all the female speakers will be put in one subset.\n",

The corpus could also be extended by creating synthetisized data, e.g. creating samples with reverb from the original samples.
