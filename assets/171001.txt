impatiently stamping and tossing their heads
requiring quite an exertion of strength to hold the men
I don't exactly like the actions of those horses Ajax remarks mr. Dinsmore
Jesse came out putting on his glove
I did not intend to have them put in hardest today

I was at the same time sensible of their motion was unusually rapid
the horses are young and fiery but Ajax is an excellent driver he replied evasively
adding
you may be sure that if I bought the danger very great I would have left Elsie at home
I reached the church without accident
put on the return
the horses took fright while going down a hill and Russia long and Furious rate
threatened every instant to upset the carriage
healthy thought they were going very fast but did not know that there was real Danger
until her father suddenly lifted her from her seat
and placing her between his knees held her tightly
as though he feared she would be snatched from his breath
he looked up into his face
it was deadly pale His Eyes Are Fixed upon or an expression of anguish
dear papa she whisper
God will take care of us
I would give all I'm worth to have you safe at home he answered Horsley
pressing her closer and closer to him
so even that moment of fearful peril
death seems just to hand
those words and the affectionate class before Father's arm
send a thrill of intense joyful of banish heart of little girl
what destruction seems inevitable
Laura was leaning back half painting with Terror
bobblehead scarcely less alarmed
well I'm a client her sobbing most bitterly
LC Lauren preserve a cheerful Serenity she had built her house upon the rock
I knew that it would stand
her Destiny was in her Heavenly father's hand
she was content to leave it there
even death had no tears to the simple unquestioning faith of little child who had put her trust in Jesus
but they were not to perish stuff
for that moment a powerful Nigro
who was walking along the road. Unusual sound turned about
what side of the vehicle coming toward him at such a rapid rate
instantly comprehending the Peril of the Travellers put himself in the middle of the road and at the risk of life and limb
hot the horses by the bridal
sudden unexpected check throwing them upon their haunches and bringing the carriage to an instant standstill
thank God we are saved
that fellow shall be well rewarded for his Brave deed explain the store Dinsmore throwing open the carriage door
that leap into the ground he lifted else The Outsider down
I gave his hand to his sister's when I do the other
they were almost at the entrance of the Avenue
I prefer to walk the short distance to the house rather than again trust themselves to the horses
mr. Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to the man who had done them such good service and to give some directions to The Coachman
I meant taking the hand cuz little girl who have been waiting for him
he walks slowly on
neither of them speaking the word until they reach the house
when he Stoops and kissed her cheek
asking very kindly if she had recovered from her fright
yes papa she answered in a quiet town
knew that God would take care of us
wasn't he good to keep us all from being killed
yes he said very Gravely go now and let Mommy get you ready for dinner
SLC was sitting alone in her room that afternoon
she was surprised by visit from Laura it being very seldom but the older girls care to enter her apartment
Laura looked a little pale
and more grave and thoughtful than else he had ever seen her
or while she sat in silence then suddenly burst out
olc I can't stop thinking all the time
what we have been kill
would we all be know where would I have been
I believe you would have gone straight to heaven LLC
oh I should have been with the rich man the minister right about this morning
lifting up my eyes and torment
Laura covered her face with her hands and shutter
at least you went on again
I was terribly frightened and still with the rest
Papa Chu LC
tell me do what kept you from being afraid
I was thinking that LC gently
turning over the leaves are probably the Bible as she spoke
this week verse
yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for that work with me
I know Laura and made me so happy to think the Jesus was there with me
if I were killed
I should only fall asleep to wake up again in his arm
and how could I be afraid
I would give anything to feel as you do so is Laura sign
tell me I'll see
I do not feel afraid for the rest of us
I'm sure you must know that we are not Christians
I don't even pretend to be
healthy blast and look down
it'll pass so quickly you know Laura
almost at the moment she said
so that I only had time to think of Papa and myself
but I prayed so much for him
do I put quite sure God would spare him until he should be prepared to die
was very selfish I know
she had 52 military
but it was only for a moment
I can't tell you how thankful I was for all our spare lives
don't look so is if you had done something very Wicked LLC
glorifying again I'm sure we've given you a little enough reason to care whatever Becomes Of Us
lol see if you can only tell me how to be a Christian
I mean now to try very hard
indeed I'm determined never to rest until I am one
Laura how glad I am cry Delphine joyfully
I know that if you are really in Earnest you will succeed
for no one ever yet fail who try to write
Jesus said
everyone to ask its receive it and he that seeketh findeth
send him that knock is it shall be opened
it's not that encouraging
Listen to What God Says hear this first
you shall seek me and find me
when you shall search for me with all your heart
so you seen your Laura
if you will only speak the Lord with your whole heart
you may be sure quite sure finding him
yes Laura but you have not answered my question
how am I to seek
that is what means am I to use to get rid of my sins and get a new heart
help make myself pleasing in the sight of God
what must I do to be saved
that is the very question that Jayla put to Paul
and he answered
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved
applied Elsie quickly turning to the chapter and pointing out the text with your fingers that Laura might see that she had pulled it correctly
in answer to your other question
partial I get rid of my sins
see here
in that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness
that isn't Zechariah
send John tells us what that found is when he says
the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
that again
unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
yes I'll see but what must I do ask Laura Lee
you Laura
only believe provide LLC in the same ernestown
Jesus has done and suffered all this necessary
now we have nothing at all to do
go to him and be washed in that phone
believe him when he says I give unto them eternal life
just accept the gift
and trust and love him that is the whole of it
images so simple that even such a little girls I can understand it
but surely LCI can I must do something
yes God tells us to repent
and he says give me thine heart you can do that
you can love Jesus at least he will enable you to if you ask him
and he will teach you to be sorry for your sins
Bible says he is exalted to give repentance and remission of sins
if you ask him
he will give them to you
it is true we cannot do anything good of ourselves without the help of the Holy Spirit we can do nothing right because we are so very Wicked
then we can always get that help if we ask for it
Jesus said
your heavenly father is more willing to give his holy spirit to them that ask him
send parents are to give good gifts to their children
oh Lord don't be afraid to ask for it
don't be afraid to come to Jesus for he says him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out
he is such a precious savior
so kind and loving
but remember that you must come very humbly
feeling that you are a great Sinner and not worthy to be heard
only hoping to be forgiven because Jesus died
Bible says
God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble
Laura linger the greater part of the afternoon in Elsie's room
asking her questions or listening to her while she read the scriptures or repeated some beautiful him
spoken to Sweet childish way
her own peace and joy in believing in Jesus
that last more went to her own room
and Elsa had another quiet half-hour to her spell
before the t-ball again called the family together
Chelsea answer the summons with a light heart
heart that thrilled with a new and strange sense of happiness
as she remembered her father's other than anxiety for her safety during their perilous ride
calling each word and look
I'm Feeling Again in imagination the class with his arm about her waist
Shirley puppet does love me
she murmured to herself over and over again
you better at the table with the kind smile
playing as Han caressingly on her head ass confectionate Tone
what is my little daughter do this evening
cheeks flushed in her eyes grew bright with happiness and she belong to throw her arms around his neck
and tell him how very very much she loves him
but that was quite impossible at the table
before all the family
so she merely raised her glad eyes to his face and answered
I'm very well thank you Papa
but after all this occurrence produced but little change in Elsie's condition
father treated her little more affectionately for a day or two
and then gradually return to his ordinary store on cold Manor
indeed before the week was out
cheapest again inside disgrace
she was walking alone in the garden one afternoon
when her attention was attracted by a slight fluttering noise which seem to proceed from Ann Arbor nearby
hastily turning into ascertain the cause she found a tiny and beautiful hummingbird
Define under a glass vase
it struggles to escape
it was fluttering and beating against the walls of its prison
just producing the sound little girl had heard in passing
healthy was very tender-hearted
I could never see any living creature in distress without feeling a strong desire to relieve his suffering
she knew that Arthur was in the habit of torturing every little insect and bird that came in his way
and it often drawn is persecutions upon herself
by interfering in behalf of the poor victim
and now the thought instantly flashed upon her that this was some of his work
that he would return air along to carry out his cool purposes
Bennett wants the rose the desire to released a little prisoner and save it for their suffering
without waiting to reflect the moment she raised the glass and the bird was gone
and she began to think with a little trimmer how angry Arthur would be
but it was too late to think about now
after all
she did not stay in very great drought of the consequences
especially as she felt nearly sure of her father's approval
what she had done having several times hurt him to approve Arthur for high school practices
not carry to meet Arthur then however she hastily retreated to the house
what she sees herself in The Veranda with a book
it was a very warm afternoon
and that being on the east side of the house and well protected by trees and Shrubbery and Vines
wasn't cool spots can be found in the play
Arthur Walter and Anna Scott on the floor playing jackstones

Elsa wanted by Arthur did not go to see after his bird
and forgot all about it in the interest with which she was pouring over the story of the Swiss Family Robinson
Jack Stone players for just finishing their game
they're all startled by the sudden appearance of mr. Horace Dinsmore up on the scene asking a ton of great Wrath
who had been down in the garden and liberated the hummingbird
you been at such pains to catch
because it was one of the rare species and he was anxious to add it to his collection of curiosity
healthy was terribly frightened
I would have been glad that moment to sink through the floor
she dropped her book in her lap
clasping her hands over her beating heart
Lupe land read by turn
well she think choking with vain effort to speak and a knowledge herself the culprit
is conscious told her she ought
father was not looking at her
cuz I was fixed on Arthur
I presume it with you sir he said very angrily and if so you may prepare yourself for either flying or a return to your prison
or one or the other I'm determined you shall have
I didn't do it any such thing replied the boy fiercely
of course you will deny it that his brother
we all know that you are worthless good-for-nothing
Papa
the trembling little voice Arthur did not do it
it was I

ulc could it be possible that this is your doing
Chelsea's book fell on the floor
and cover your face with both hands she burst into sobs and tears

I didn't know it was your birthday
I didn't mean to be naughty
no you never mean to be naughty according to your own account he said
bad this is all accident
but nevertheless I find you a very Troublesome mischievous child
he was only the other day you broke a valuable vase
he forgot and his anger how little she had really been to blame for that
and now you have caused me the loss of a rare specimen
which I had spent a great deal of time and effort and procuring
really I'll see I'm sorely tempted to administer a very severe punishment
healthy coffee arm of the city for support
tell me what you did it for was if your love of mischief
ask your father sternly
taking hold of her arm and holding her up by it
no papa chance almost under her breath
I was sorry for the little bird
I thought Arthur and put it there to portrait

FunForMobile he was half inclined to kiss and forgive her

and Wildlife distinguished little spark of love and compassion
did Burn For a Moment his heart

so we would not inflict physical pain
CLC Lac Louise maliciously
stealing his pocket for the night
I suspect he intends to cut your hand off
Chelsea started in the tearful eyes of rays to her father's face with a look half of terrified entreaty
half of confidence that such could not be his intention
Crush Louise explain her brother's Thornley
you know you are not speaking truly and that I would assume think of cutting off my own hand as my child
you should never speak anything but truth especially to children
I think it's well enough to frighten them a little sometimes and I thought that was what you were going to do
replied Louise
looking somewhat mortified the rebuke
know that her brother that is very bad plan
in which I shall never adopt
LC will learn in time if she does not know it now
so I never addressed right which I do not intend to carry out and never break my word
kid drawn a handkerchief in his pocket while speaking

those who cannot use their hands of right must be deprived of the use of them
there let me see if that will keep it out of mischief
Bishop I will pain in foot before a long if you continue this mischievous pranks
now go to a room and stay there until pee time
Elsa felt deeply bitterly disgraced and humiliated
she turned to obey
and it needed not Arthur's triumphant chuckle
you're the smoke of satisfaction and a space to add to the key and suffering for Food and Spirit
like punishment was more to her this if your chest size and it would have been
many another child
the very knowledge of her father's displeasure was enough at any time
to cause great pain to her sensitive spirit and gentle loving heart
Walter who was far more tender-hearted than either his brother or sister
touched by the side of her distress and red after her to say
nevermind I'll see
I'm ever so sorry for you and I don't think you were the least bit naughty
she thinks it was a grateful look
the faint attempt to smile through her tears
then hurry down to her room where she seated herself in a chair by the window
laying her arms up on the Sill
arrested her head upon them
and while the bitter tears fell fast from her eyes
he murmured half of loud

always doing something to displease my dear pop
how I wish I could be good and make him love me
I'm afraid he never will if 5x and so often
set an Earnest importunate prayer for help to do right

what up from the almost despairing little heart
to him whose ear is ever opening to The Cry Of The Suffering children
Santos between weeping morning and praying

feeling that she would much rather do without her supper
in the show roots are swollen eyes and tied up and can't able

I felt that everybody else was looking at her and thinking

poor child
pop would only quit looking at me
the rest would forget all about me either supper
maybe I could keep from crying
then she said that the silent prayer for help
struggling hard to keep back the tears and sobs that Rome was suffocating her
I'm picking up her slice of bread
hi to eat
she's very thankful to her aunt Adelaide
addressing a question to her papa just at that moment
just taking his attention from her
and then adroitly setting them all to talking
little little girl had had time to recover her composure at least in a measure

taking your hand and leading her out to the veranda
resetting some self in an easy chair and lighted a cigar

try to amuse herself with her own thoughts
and watching the expression of his countenance as he read on and on
Turning Leaf after leaf
too much interest in his book to take any further notice her
how handsome my papa is
the little girl gazing with affectionate admiration to his face
and then she sighed
and the tears tremble in her eyes again

too long to lay your head on your father's knee
