candidate for president I promise that my Administration would fight every day for American workers
years of unfair trade have hammered American families and plundered American well
solutely terrible for a country
we turned a blind eye while other nations targeted our industry
ransacked rfactor
took advantage of our country they took advantage of our people
over the last two decades the United States racked up
12.5 trillion-dollar trade deficits
can goods and watch nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs
disappear or go to other countries
we Finance the rise of other countries at the expense of our own middle-class people
get our leaders in Washington did absolutely nothing
they allowed other countries to cheek
to break the rules and to steal our jobs with impunity
politicians responded to economic aggression with economic surrender not anymore
not going to happen
we're standing up for our families are Factory workers and our way of life
my Administration here's your voice
and has your back
after a thorough investigation my Administration document is China's unfair Trade Practices
including forced technology transfers
as a result of this investigation we're taking concrete actions to stop this abuse
including proposing tariffs on select Imports designed to save our Industries for the future
we have no other choice
we'll get along with China they'll be friends of ours but they just can't take advantage of us any longer we will have a great relationship with China but it will be a fair relationship not like it was
we will also no longer tolerate unfair and non-reciprocal
trading practices
not only with China but with anyone
and my Administration will use all available authorities to protect
how great farmers
we love our Farmers we're going to take care of our farm is
we want fair and reciprocal trade
what countries open their markets in equal measure and all sides play by the rules
and that hasn't been happening in the past
what we won't tolerate are one-sided deals
where we open our markets while other countries close there's
only by standing up for ourselves can we end the abuse
restore our prosperity
Henry Clay more economic independence
we're going to make America wealthy again not only great again
thank you God bless you and God bless
America
