yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me

Psalm 23:4
Kidz Bop the cruel artifacts of fate
to refine in very on our worth
phrases from the spare and give us hope
Only The Plunge in the golf again
and make a stubbly wretched
crap a prima
it was Sabbath morning and LC ready dress for church
the Portico waiting for her father to come down and lift her into the carriage
in which adelheid Luisa and Anna were already stated
The Coachman was in his seat
the horses a pair of young and fiery Steve purchased by Mr Dinsmore
only a few days before
impatiently stamping and tossing their head
requiring quite an exertion of strength to hold the men
I don't exactly like the actions of those horses Ajax remarks mr. Dinsmore as he came out putting on his glove
I did not intend to have them put in hardest today
why did you not give us the Old Bay
Cosmos the hearth
okay she's got a lame foot
an old Master he said these youngsters got to be you sometime or another and I reckon I might just as well use them today
you feel quite sure being able to hold them in ask his master
blessing unusually first at the horse and then at LC
I mastered this year child but able to hold it almost anything
when the Negril exhibiting a double row of dazzling white teeth
and besides I just drove D's here horse twice for now and they want splendid
holdeman Jessica easy as nothing
Alfie said her father still looking a little uneasy in spite of Ajax and boasting
I think it would be just as well for you to stay at home
how to make no reply in Word
but her answering looks both such intense disappointment
Ernest entry
well I suppose there is no real danger and since you seem so anxious to go I will not compel you to stay home
lifted her into the carriage
and feeding himself besider order The Coachman to drive on as carefully as he could
selfie change seats with me
Anna
I want to sit beside brother Horus
no reply biscuit Dinsmore laying his hand on his little daughter shoulder
healthy places by me and she shocked that nowhere else
do you think we are in any danger being run away with a satellite a little anxiously as she observed him glancing once or twice out of the window
I wasn't the same time sensible of their motion with unusually rapid
the horses are young in fiery but Ajax is an excellent driver he replied evasively
adding
you may be sure that if I thought the danger very great I would have left Alfie at home
they reached the church without accident
put on the return the horses took fright while going down a hill and Russia long at a furious rate
threatened every instant to upset the carriage
healthy thought they were going very fast but did not know that there was real Danger
until her father suddenly lifted her from her seat
and placing her between his knees held her tightly
as though he feared she would be snatched on his grass
he looked up into his face
who is deadly pay on his eyes are fixed upon or an expression of anguish
dear papa she whisper
God will take care of us
I would give all I'm worth to have you safe at home he answered Horsley
pressing her closer and closer to him
so even that moment of fearful peril
death themes Justin hand
those words and the affectionate class before Father's arm
send a thrill of intense joyful of famished heart of little girl
but destruction seems inevitable
or was leaning back half painting with Terror
I'm hyped scarcely less alarm
while I want her sobbing most bitterly
of the loan preserve a cheerful serenity
she had built her house upon the rock and move it would stand
her Destiny was in her Heavenly father's hand
and she was content to leave it there
even death had no tears to the simple unquestioning faith of little child
I would put her trust in Jesus
but they were not to perish the
for that moment a powerful Nigro
I was walking along the road hearing unusual sound
turn about
what side of the vehicle coming toward him at the rapid rate and instantly comprehending the Peril of The Travelers planted himself in the middle of the road and at the risk of life and limb
cut the horses by the bridal
the sudden unexpected check throwing them upon their haunches and bringing the carriage to an instant standstill
thank God we are saved
that fellow shall be well rewarded for his Brave D explain mr. Dinsmore throwing open the carriage door
that leap into the ground he lifted LC outside her down and gave his hand to his sister's when I do the other
they were almost at the entrance of the Avenue and all prefer to walk the shortest this to the house rather than again trust themselves to the horses
mr. Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to the man who had done them such good service and to give them directions to The Coachman
I meant taking the hand of a little girl who had been waiting for him
walk slowly on
neither of them speaking the word until they reach the house
when he Stoops and kissed her cheek
African Grey kindly if she recovered from her fright
Papa she answered in the quiet tone
I knew that God would take care of us
wasn't he good to keep us all from being killed
Jesse said very Gravely go now and let Mommy get you ready for dinner
he was sitting alone in her room that afternoon she was surprised by visit from Laura it being very seldom but the older girl scared to enter her apartment
Laura looked a little pale and more grave and thoughtful than else he had ever seen her
or while she sat in silence
then suddenly burst out
olp I can't help thinking all the time
what we had been killed
would we all be know where would I have been
I believe you would have gone straight to heaven LLC
I oh I should have been with the rich man the minister read about this morning lifting up my eyes and torment
Laura covered her face with her hands and shutter
at least you went on again
I was terribly frightened and so with the rest
Papa Chu Elfie
tell me do what kept you from being afraid
I was thinking that LC gently turning over the leaves the problem Bible as she spoke
sweet birth
yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
that were with me
I know Laura and made me so happy to think that Jesus was there with me
and if I were killed
I should only fall asleep to wake up again in his arm
then how could I be afraid
I would give anything to feel as you do does Laura sign
tell me I'll see
did you not feel afraid for the rest of us
I'm sure you must know that we are not Christians
we don't even pretend to be
healthy blast and look down
little pasta quickly you know Laura
almost at the moment she said
so that I only had time to think of Papa and myself and I have prayed so much for him that I felt quite sure God would spare have until he should be prepared to die
was very selfish I know
she added with deep humility
it was only for a moment and I can't tell you how thankful I was for all our spare lives
don't look so if if you had done something very Wicked LLC
replied Laura sign again I'm sure we've given you a little enough reason to care whatever becomes the bus
lol see if you can only tell me how to be a Christian
I mean now to try very hard
indeed I'm determined never to rest until I am one
Laura how glad I am cry Delphine joyfully for I know that if you are really in Earnest you will succeed
for no one ever yet fail who try to write
Jesus said
everyone to ask its receive it and he that seeketh findeth
send them that knock is it shall be opened
it's not that encouraging
listen to what God says here in this birth
you shall seek me and find me
when you shall search for me with all your heart
so you seen your Laura if you will only seek the Lord with your whole heart
you may be sure quite sure finding him
yes is Laura but you have not answered my question
how am I to speak
what means am I to use to get rid of my sins and get a new heart
how to make myself pleasing in the sight of God
what must I do to be saved
that's a very question. Jailer put the Paul and he answered believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved
applied Elsie quickly turning to the chapter and pointing out the text with her finger that Laura might see that she had posted it correctly
an answer to your other question how shall I get rid of my sins
we here
in that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness
that isn't Zechariah
send John tells what that Fountain is
when he says
the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
that again
unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
yes I'll see but what must I do ask Lori Greeley
do Laura
only believe replied LC in the same ernestown
Jesus has done and suffered all that is necessary
and now we have nothing at all to do but go to him and be washed in that phone
believe him when he says
I give unto them eternal life
just accept the gift
entrusted love him that is the whole of it
images so simple that even such a little girls I can understand it
what Shirley LCI can I must do something
yes God tells us to repent
and he says give me thine heart you can do that you can love Jesus at least he will enable you to if you ask him
and he will teach you to be sorry for your sins
the Bible says he is exalted to give repentance and remission of sins
and if you ask him he will give them to you
it is true we cannot do anything good of ourselves without the help of the Holy Spirit we can do nothing right because we are so very Wicked
then we can always get that help if we ask for it
Jesus dead
your heavenly father is more willing to give his holy spirit to them that ask him then parents are to give good gifts to their children
oh Lord don't be afraid to ask for it
don't be afraid to come to Jesus
or he says he that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out
he is such a precious savior
so kind and loving
but remember that you must come very humbly feeling that you are a great Sinner and not worthy to be heard
and only hoping to be forgiven because Jesus died
the Bible says
God resisteth the proud but gives grace to the humble
Laura linger the greater part of the afternoon in Elsie's room asking her questions or listening to her
well she read the scriptures
I'll repeat it some beautiful him
sweet childish way
of her own peace and joy in believing in Jesus
but it lasts more went to her own room and Elsa had another quiet half-hour to her spell before the t-ball again called the family together
of the answer the summons with a light heart
a heart that thrilled with a new and strange sense of Happiness as she remembered her father's evident anxiety for her safety during her perilous ride
calling each word and look
I'm Feeling Again in imagination the class with his arm about her waist
Shirley Papa does love me
remember to myself over and over again
when we met her at the table with the kind smile
I'm laying his head caressingly on her head asked and affectionate tone
how does my little daughter doing this evening
your cheeks flushed in her eyes grew bright with happiness and she belong to throw her arms around his neck
and tell him how very very much she loved him
but that was quite impossible at the table
before all the family
so she merely raise so glad eyes to his face and answered
I'm very well thank you Papa
after all this the car is produced but little change now his condition
your father treated her a little more affectionately for a day or two
and then gradually return to his ordinary store on cold Manor
indeed before the week was out
she was again inside disgrace
she was walking alone in the garden one afternoon
when her attention was attracted by a slight fluttering noise which seem to proceed from the arbor nearby
Adam haseley turning in to ascertain the cause she found a tiny and beautiful hummingbird confined under a glass vase
it struggles to escape
it was fluttering and beating against the walls of the prison
reducing the sound little girl had heard in passing
healthy was very tender-hearted and could never see any living creature in distress without feeling a strong desire to relieve is suffering
she knew that Arthur was in the habit of torturing every little insect and bird that came in his way
I said often drawn is persecutions upon herself by interfering in behalf of the poor victim
and now the thought instantly flashed upon her that this was some of his work and that he would return air along to carry out his cool purposes
Bennett wants the rose that is ours released a little prisoner and save it for their suffering
without waiting to reflect the moment she raised the glass and the bird was gone
then she began to think with a little trimmer how angry Arthur would be
but it was too late to think about now
and after all she did not stand in very great drought of the consequences
especially as she felt nearly sure of her father's approval of what she had done having several times hurting reprove Arthur for high school practices
