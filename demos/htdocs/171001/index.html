ANSWERING LOOK SPOKE SUCH INTENSE DISAPPOINTMENT SUCH EARNEST ENTREATY THAT SAYING AH WELL I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO REAL DANGER AND SINCE YOU SEEM SO ANXIOUS TO GO I WILL NOT COMPEL YOU TO STAY AT HOME HE LIFTED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE AND SEATING HIMSELF BESIDE HER ORDERED THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON AS CAREFULLY AS HE COULD ELSIE CHANGE SEATS WITH ME NO REPLIED MISTER DINSMORE LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER'S SHOULDER ELSIE'S PLACE IS BY ME AND SHE SHALL SIT NOWHERE ELSE DO YOU THINK WE ARE IN ANY DANGER OF BEING RUN AWAY WITH ASKED ADELAIDE A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE OBSERVED HIM GLANCING ONCE OR TWICE OUT OF THE WINDOW THE HORSES ARE YOUNG AND FIERY BUT AJAX IS AN EXCELLENT DRIVER HE REPLIED EVASIVELY ADDING YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IF I HAD THOUGHT THE DANGER VERY GREAT I WOULD HAVE LEFT ELSIE AT HOME THEY REACHED THE CHURCH WITHOUT ACCIDENT AND WAS AT THE SAME TIME SENSIBLE THAT THEIR MOTION WAS UNUSUALLY RAPID BUT ON THEIR RETURN THE HORSES TOOK FRIGHT WHILE GOING DOWN A HILL AND RUSHED ALONG AT A FURIOUS RATE WHICH THREATENED EVERY INSTANT TO UPSET THE CARRIAGE ELSIE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING VERY FAST BUT DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS REAL DANGER UNTIL HER FATHER SUDDENLY LIFTED HER FROM HER SEAT AND PLACING HER BETWEEN HIS KNEES HELD HER TIGHTLY AS THOUGH HE FEARED SHE WOULD BE SNATCHED FROM HIS GRASP ELSIE LOOKED UP INTO HIS FACE DEAR PAPA SHE WHISPERED GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF US I WOULD GIVE ALL I AM WORTH TO HAVE YOU SAFE AT HOME HE ANSWERED HOARSELY PRESSING HER CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIM O EVEN IN THAT MOMENT OF FEARFUL PERIL IT WAS DEADLY PALE AND HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ANGUISH WHEN DEATH SEEMED JUST AT HAND THOSE WORDS AND THE AFFECTIONATE CLASP OF HER FATHER'S ARM SENT A THRILL OF INTENSE JOY TO THE LOVE FAMISHED HEART OF THE LITTLE GIRL BUT DESTRUCTION SEEMED INEVITABLE LORA WAS LEANING BACK HALF FAINTING WITH TERROR ADELAIDE SCARCELY LESS ALARMED WHILE ENNA CLUNG TO HER SOBBING MOST BITTERLY ELSIE ALONE PRESERVED A CHEERFUL SERENITY SHE HAD BUILT HER HOUSE UPON THE ROCK AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD STAND HER DESTINY WAS IN HER HEAVENLY FATHER'S HANDS AND SHE WAS CONTENT TO LEAVE IT THERE EVEN DEATH HAD NO TERRORS WHO HAD PUT HER TRUST IN JESUS BUT THEY WERE NOT TO PERISH THUS FOR AT THAT MOMENT A POWERFUL NEGRO TO THE SIMPLE UNQUESTIONING FAITH OF THE LITTLE CHILD TURNED ABOUT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE VEHICLE COMING TOWARD HIM AT SUCH A RAPID RATE AND INSTANTLY COMPREHENDING THE PERIL OF THE TRAVELLERS PLANTED HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND AT THE RISK OF LIFE AND LIMB CAUGHT THE HORSES BY THE BRIDLE WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD HEARING AN UNUSUAL SOUND THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED CHECK THROWING THEM UPON THEIR HAUNCHES AND BRINGING THE CARRIAGE TO AN INSTANT STAND STILL THANK GOD WE ARE SAVED THAT FELLOW SHALL BE WELL REWARDED FOR HIS BRAVE DEED EXCLAIMED MISTER DINSMORE THROWING OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR THEN LEAPING TO THE GROUND HE LIFTED ELSIE OUT SET HER DOWN AND GAVE HIS HAND TO HIS SISTERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE AVENUE AND ALL PREFERRED TO WALK THE SHORT DISTANCE TO THE HOUSE RATHER THAN AGAIN TRUST THEMSELVES TO THE HORSES MISTER DINSMORE LINGERED A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO THE MAN WHO HAD DONE THEM SUCH GOOD SERVICE AND TO GIVE SOME DIRECTIONS TO THE COACHMAN AND THEN TAKING THE HAND OF HIS LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM HE WALKED SLOWLY ON ASKING VERY KINDLY IF SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER FRIGHT YES PAPA SHE ANSWERED IN A QUIET TONE I KNEW THAT GOD WOULD TAKE CARE OF US OH WASN'T HE GOOD TO KEEP US ALL FROM BEING KILLED YES HE SAID VERY GRAVELY GO NOW AND LET MAMMY GET YOU READY FOR DINNER AS ELSIE WAS SITTING ALONE IN HER ROOM THAT AFTERNOON IT BEING VERY SELDOM THAT THE ELDER GIRLS CARED TO ENTER HER APARTMENT LORA LOOKED A LITTLE PALE AND MORE GRAVE AND THOUGHTFUL THAN ELSIE HAD EVER SEEN HER FOR A WHILE SHE SAT IN SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BURST OUT OH ELSIE I CAN'T HELP THINKING ALL THE TIME SHE WAS SURPRISED BY A VISIT FROM LORA WHAT IF WE HAD BEEN KILLED WHERE WOULD WE ALL BE NOW WHERE WOULD I HAVE BEEN I BELIEVE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN ELSIE BUT LIFTING UP MY EYES IN TORMENT AND LORA COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHUDDERED PRESENTLY SHE WENT ON AGAIN I WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND SO WERE THE REST ALL BUT YOU ELSIE TELL ME DO WHAT KEPT YOU FROM BEING AFRAID I WAS THINKING SAID ELSIE GENTLY TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF HER LITTLE BIBLE AS SHE SPOKE OF THIS SWEET VERSE YEA THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME AND OH LORA IT MADE ME SO HAPPY TO THINK THAT JESUS WAS THERE WITH ME AND THAT IF I WERE KILLED I SHOULD ONLY FALL ASLEEP TO WAKE UP AGAIN IN HIS ARMS THEN HOW COULD I BE AFRAID AH I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO FEEL AS YOU DO SAID LORA SIGHING BUT TELL ME ELSIE DID YOU NOT FEEL AFRAID FOR THE REST OF US I'M SURE YOU MUST KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT CHRISTIANS WE DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO BE ELSIE BLUSHED AND LOOKED DOWN IT ALL PASSED SO QUICKLY YOU KNOW LORA ALMOST IN A MOMENT SHE SAID SO THAT I ONLY HAD TIME TO THINK OF PAPA AND MYSELF AND I HAVE PRAYED SO MUCH FOR HIM DON'T LOOK SO AS IF YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING VERY WICKED ELSIE THAT I FELT QUITE SURE GOD WOULD SPARE HIM UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DIE IT WAS VERY SELFISH I KNOW SHE ADDED WITH DEEP HUMILITY BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT AND I CANT TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I WAS FOR _ALL_ OUR SPARED LIVES BUT OH ELSIE IF YOU CAN ONLY TELL ME HOW TO BE A CHRISTIAN I MEAN NOW TO TRY VERY HARD INDEED I AM DETERMINED NEVER TO REST UNTIL I AM ONE OH LORA HOW GLAD I AM CRIED ELSIE JOYFULLY REPLIED LORA SIGHING AGAIN IM SURE WE HAVE GIVEN YOU LITTLE ENOUGH REASON TO CARE WHATEVER BECOMES OF US FOR I KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE REALLY IN EARNEST YOU WILL SUCCEED AND HE THAT SEEKETH FINDETH AND TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED IS NOT THAT ENCOURAGING AND LISTEN TO WHAT GOD SAYS HERE IN THIS VERSE YE SHALL SEEK ME AND FIND ME WHEN YE SHALL SEARCH FOR ME WITH ALL YOUR HEART SO YOU SEE DEAR LORA IF YOU WILL ONLY SEEK THE LORD WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART YOU MAY BE SURE QUITE SURE OF FINDING HIM YES SAID LORA BUT YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION HOW AM I TO SEEK THAT IS WHAT MEANS AM I TO USE TO GET RID OF MY SINS AND GET A NEW HEART HOW MAKE MYSELF PLEASING IN THE SIGHT OF GOD WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED AND HE ANSWERED BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED AND IN ANSWER TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION HOW SHALL I GET RID OF MY SINS SEE HERE IN THAT DAY THERE SHALL BE A FOUNTAIN OPENED TO THE HOUSE OF DAVID AND TO THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM FOR SIN AND FOR UNCLEANLINESS THAT IS IN ZECHARIAH REPLIED ELSIE QUICKLY TURNING TO THE CHAPTER AND POINTING OUT THE TEXT WITH HER FINGER THAT LORA MIGHT SEE THAT SHE HAD QUOTED IT CORRECTLY THEN JOHN TELLS US WHAT THAT FOUNTAIN IS WHEN HE SAYS THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HIS SON CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN AND AGAIN UNTO HIM THAT LOVED US AND WASHED US FROM OUR SINS IN HIS OWN BLOOD YES ELSIE BUT WHAT MUST I DO ASKED LORA EAGERLY DO LORA ONLY BELIEVE REPLIED ELSIE IN THE SAME EARNEST TONE JESUS HAS DONE AND SUFFERED ALL THAT IS NECESSARY AND NOW WE HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO BUT GO TO HIM AND BE WASHED IN THAT FOUNTAIN BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS I GIVE UNTO THEM ETERNAL LIFE JUST ACCEPT THE GIFT AND TRUST AND LOVE HIM THAT IS THE WHOLE OF IT AND IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT EVEN SUCH A LITTLE GIRL AS I CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT SURELY ELSIE I CAN I MUST DO SOMETHING YES GOD TELLS US TO REPENT AND HE SAYS GIVE ME THINE HEART YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN LOVE JESUS AT LEAST HE WILL ENABLE YOU TO IF YOU ASK HIM AND HE WILL TEACH YOU TO BE SORRY FOR YOUR SINS THE BIBLE SAYS HE IS EXALTED TO GIVE REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS AND IF YOU ASK HIM HE WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU IT IS TRUE WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING GOOD OF OURSELVES WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WE CAN DO NOTHING RIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE SO VERY WICKED BUT THEN WE CAN ALWAYS GET THAT HELP IF WE ASK FOR IT JESUS SAID YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS MORE WILLING TO GIVE HIS HOLY SPIRIT TO THEM THAT ASK HIM THAN PARENTS ARE TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS UNTO THEIR CHILDREN OH LORA DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR IT DON'T BE AFRAID TO COME TO JESUS FOR HE SAYS AND HE IS SUCH A PRECIOUS SAVIOUR SO KIND AND LOVING BUT REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST COME VERY HUMBLY FEELING THAT YOU ARE A GREAT SINNER AND NOT WORTHY TO BE HEARD AND ONLY HOPING TO BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE JESUS DIED THE BIBLE SAYS HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME I WILL IN NOWISE CAST OUT GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD BUT GIVETH GRACE UNTO THE HUMBLE ELSIE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH A LIGHT HEART A HEART THAT THRILLED WITH A NEW AND STRANGE SENSE OF HAPPINESS AS SHE REMEMBERED HER FATHER'S EVIDENT ANXIETY FOR HER SAFETY DURING THEIR PERILOUS RIDE RECALLING EACH WORD AND LOOK LORA LINGERED THE GREATER PART OF THE AFTERNOON IN ELSIES ROOM ASKING HER QUESTIONS OR LISTENING TO HER WHILE SHE READ THE SCRIPTURES OR REPEATED SOME BEAUTIFUL HYMN OR SPOKE IN HER SWEET CHILDISH WAY OF HER OWN PEACE AND JOY IN BELIEVING IN JESUS BUT AT LAST LORA WENT TO HER OWN ROOM AND ELSIE HAD ANOTHER QUIET HALF HOUR TO HERSELF BEFORE THE TEA BELL AGAIN CALLED THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND FEELING AGAIN IN IMAGINATION THE CLASP OF HIS ARM ABOUT HER WAIST AH SURELY PAPA DOES LOVE ME SHE MURMURED TO HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WHEN HE MET HER AT THE TABLE WITH A KIND SMILE HOW DOES MY LITTLE DAUGHTER DO THIS EVENING HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES GREW BRIGHT WITH HAPPINESS AND SHE LONGED TO THROW HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND TELL HIM HOW VERY VERY MUCH SHE LOVED HIM BUT THAT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE TABLE AND BEFORE ALL THE FAMILY AND LAYING HIS HAND CARESSINGLY ON HER HEAD ASKED IN AN AFFECTIONATE TONE SO SHE MERELY RAISED HER GLAD EYES TO HIS FACE AND ANSWERED I AM VERY WELL THANK YOU PAPA BUT AFTER ALL THIS OCCURRENCE PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN ELSIE'S CONDITION HER FATHER TREATED HER A LITTLE MORE AFFECTIONATELY FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THEN GRADUALLY RETURNED TO HIS ORDINARY STERN COLD MANNER INDEED BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT SHE WAS AGAIN IN SAD DISGRACE SHE WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HER ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A SLIGHT FLUTTERING NOISE WHICH SEEMED TO PROCEED FROM AN ARBOR NEAR BY AND ON HASTILY TURNING IN TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE SHE FOUND A TINY AND BEAUTIFUL HUMMING BIRD CONFINED UNDER A GLASS VASE IN ITS STRUGGLES TO ESCAPE IT WAS FLUTTERING AND BEATING AGAINST THE WALLS OF ITS PRISON THUS PRODUCING THE SOUND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD HEARD IN PASSING ELSIE WAS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND COULD NEVER SEE ANY LIVING CREATURE IN DISTRESS WITHOUT FEELING A STRONG DESIRE TO RELIEVE ITS SUFFERINGS AND HAD OFTEN DRAWN HIS PERSECUTIONS UPON HERSELF BY INTERFERING IN BEHALF OF THE POOR VICTIM AND NOW THE THOUGHT INSTANTLY FLASHED UPON HER THAT THIS WAS SOME OF HIS WORK AND THAT HE WOULD RETURN ERE LONG TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL PURPOSES THEN AT ONCE AROSE THE DESIRE TO RELEASE THE LITTLE PRISONER AND SAVE IT FURTHER SUFFERING THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH A LITTLE TREMOR HOW ANGRY ARTHUR WOULD BE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND AFTER ALL SHE DID NOT STAND IN VERY GREAT DREAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY AS SHE FELT NEARLY SURE OF HER FATHER'S APPROVAL OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND WITHOUT WAITING TO REFLECT A MOMENT SHE RAISED THE GLASS AND THE BIRD WAS GONE HAVING SEVERAL TIMES HEARD HIM REPROVE ARTHUR FOR HIS CRUEL PRACTICES NOT CARING TO MEET ARTHUR THEN HOWEVER SHE HASTILY RETREATED TO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE SEATED HERSELF IN THE VERANDA WITH A BOOK IT WAS A VERY WARM AFTERNOON ARTHUR WALTER AND ENNA SAT ON THE FLOOR PLAYING JACK STONES A FAVORITE GAME WITH THEM AND THAT BEING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND WELL PROTECTED BY TREES SHRUBBERY AND VINES WAS AS COOL A SPOT AS COULD BE FOUND ON THE PLACE HUSH SHE SAID AS WALTER GAVE A SUDDEN SHOUT AT A SUCCESSFUL TOSS ENNA HAD JUST MADE CAN'T YOU BE QUIET AND LOUISE WAS STRETCHED FULL LENGTH ON A SETTEE BURIED IN THE LATEST NOVEL ELSIE WONDERED WHY ARTHUR DID NOT GO TO SEE AFTER HIS BIRD BUT SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT IN THE INTEREST WITH WHICH SHE WAS PORING OVER THE STORY OF THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON THE JACK STONE PLAYERS WERE JUST FINISHING THEIR GAME MAMMA IS TAKING HER AFTERNOON NAP AND YOU WILL DISTURB HER AND BESIDES I CANNOT READ IN SUCH A NOISE WHEN THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF MISTER HORACE DINSMORE UPON THE SCENE WHO HAD BEEN DOWN IN THE GARDEN AND LIBERATED THE HUMMING BIRD HE HAD BEEN AT SUCH PAINS TO CATCH BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF A RARE SPECIES ELSIE WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND HE WAS ANXIOUS TO ADD IT TO HIS COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES GREW PALE AND RED BY TURNS WHILE SHE SEEMED CHOKING WITH THE VAIN EFFORT TO SPEAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE HERSELF THE CULPRIT AS CONSCIENCE TOLD HER SHE OUGHT BUT HER FATHER WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER HIS EYE WAS FIXED ON ARTHUR AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD AT THAT MOMENT TO SINK THROUGH THE FLOOR SHE DROPPED HER BOOK IN HER LAP AND CLASPING HER HANDS OVER HER BEATING HEART I PRESUME IT WAS YOU SIR HE SAID VERY ANGRILY AND IF SO YOU MAY PREPARE YOURSELF FOR EITHER A FLOGGING OR A RETURN TO YOUR PRISON FOR ONE OR THE OTHER I AM DETERMINED YOU SHALL HAVE I DIDN'T DO IT ANY SUCH THING REPLIED THE BOY FIERCELY OF COURSE YOU WILL DENY IT SAID HIS BROTHER BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT YOUR WORD IS GOOD FOR NOTHING PAPA ARTHUR DID NOT DO IT IT WAS I SAID A TREMBLING LITTLE VOICE AS HE TURNED HIS FLASHING EYE UPON HER YOU EXCLAIMED HER FATHER IN A TONE OF MINGLED ANGER AND ASTONISHMENT ELSIE'S BOOK FELL ON THE FLOOR AND COVERING HER FACE WITH BOTH HANDS SHE BURST INTO SOBS AND TEARS COME HERE TO ME THIS INSTANT HE SAID SEATING HIMSELF ON THE SETTEE FROM WHICH LOUISE HAD RISEN ON HIS ENTRANCE _YOU_ ELSIE CAN IT BE _POSSIBLE_ THAT THIS IS _YOUR_ DOING COME HERE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY MEDDLING WITH MY AFFAIRS IN THIS WAY PLEASE PAPA PLEASE DON'T BE SO VERY ANGRY WITH ME AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE NAUGHTY NO YOU NEVER MEAN TO BE NAUGHTY ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN ACCOUNT HE SAID YOUR BADNESS IS ALL ACCIDENT BUT NEVERTHELESS I FIND YOU A VERY TROUBLESOME MISCHIEVOUS CHILD IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER DAY YOU BROKE A VALUABLE VASE HE FORGOT IN HIS ANGER HOW LITTLE SHE HAD REALLY BEEN TO BLAME FOR THAT AND NOW YOU HAVE CAUSED ME THE LOSS OF A RARE SPECIMEN WHICH I HAD SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EFFORT IN PROCURING REALLY ELSIE I AM SORELY TEMPTED TO ADMINISTER A VERY SEVERE PUNISHMENT ELSIE CAUGHT AT THE ARM OF THE SETTEE FOR SUPPORT TELL ME WHAT YOU DID IT FOR WAS IT PURE LOVE OF MISCHIEF ASKED HER FATHER STERNLY TAKING HOLD OF HER ARM AND HOLDING HER UP BY IT NO PAPA SHE ANSWERED ALMOST UNDER HER BREATH I WAS SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BIRD I THOUGHT ARTHUR HAD PUT IT THERE TO TORTURE IT AND SO I LET IT GO AND THE TEARS FELL FASTER AND FASTER INDEED SAID HE YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO MEDDLE WITH IT LET WHO WOULD HAVE PUT IT THERE WHICH HAND DID IT THIS ONE PAPA SOBBED THE CHILD INDICATING HER RIGHT HAND HE TOOK IT IN HIS AND HELD IT A MOMENT I DID NOT MEAN TO DO WRONG PAPA INDEED I DID NOT HE LOOKED AT THE DOWNCAST TEARFUL FACE THE BOSOM HEAVING WITH SOBS AND THEN AT THE LITTLE TREMBLING HAND HE HELD SO SOFT AND WHITE AND TENDER AND THE STERNNESS OF HIS COUNTENANCE RELAXED SOMEWHAT IT SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO INFLICT PAIN UPON ANYTHING SO TENDER AND HELPLESS WHILE THE LITTLE GIRL STOOD TREMBLINGLY AWAITING WHAT WAS TO COME NEXT AND FOR A MOMENT HE WAS HALF INCLINED TO KISS AND FORGIVE HER BUT NO HE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH IRRITATED AT HIS LOSS AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT AGAIN AROUSED HIS ANGER AND WELL NIGH EXTINGUISHED THE LITTLE SPARK OF LOVE AND COMPASSION SHE SHOULD BE PUNISHED THOUGH HE WOULD NOT INFLICT PHYSICAL PAIN SEE ELSIE LAUGHED LOUISE MALICIOUSLY THAT HAD BURNED FOR A MOMENT IN HIS HEART I SUSPECT HE INTENDS TO CUT YOUR HAND OFF ELSIE STARTED AND THE TEARFUL EYES WERE RAISED TO HER FATHER'S FACE WITH A LOOK HALF OF TERRIFIED ENTREATY HALF OF CONFIDENCE THAT SUCH COULD NOT BE HIS INTENTION HUSH LOUISE EXCLAIMED HER BROTHER STERNLY YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING TRULY AND THAT I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF CUTTING OFF MY OWN HAND AS MY CHILD'S YOU SHOULD NEVER SPEAK ANYTHING BUT TRUTH ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN NO SAID HER BROTHER THAT IS A VERY BAD PLAN AND ONE WHICH I SHALL NEVER ADOPT ELSIE WILL LEARN IN TIME IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT NOW THAT I NEVER UTTER A THREAT WHICH I DO NOT INTEND TO CARRY OUT AND NEVER BREAK MY WORD HE HAD DRAWN A HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET WHILE SPEAKING I SHALL TIE THIS HAND UP ELSIE HE SAID PROCEEDING TO DO SO THOSE WHO DO NOT USE THEIR HANDS ARIGHT MUST BE DEPRIVED OF THE USE OF THEM THERE LET ME SEE IF THAT WILL KEEP IT OUT OF MISCHIEF I SHALL TIE YOU UP HAND AND FOOT BEFORE LONG IF YOU CONTINUE SUCH MISCHIEVOUS PRANKS ELSIE FELT DEEPLY BITTERLY DISGRACED AND HUMILIATED AS SHE TURNED TO OBEY AND IT NEEDED NOT ARTHUR'S TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE NOR THE SMIRK OF SATISFACTION ON ENNA'S FACE TO ADD TO THE KEEN SUFFERING OF HER WOUNDED SPIRIT NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM AND STAY THERE UNTIL TEA TIME THIS SLIGHT PUNISHMENT WAS MORE TO HER THAN A SEVERE CHASTISEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MANY ANOTHER CHILD FOR THE VERY KNOWLEDGE OF HER FATHER'S DISPLEASURE WAS ENOUGH AT ANY TIME TO CAUSE GREAT PAIN TO HER SENSITIVE SPIRIT AND GENTLE LOVING HEART WALTER WHO WAS FAR MORE TENDER HEARTED THAN EITHER HIS BROTHER OR SISTER FELT TOUCHED BY THE SIGHT OF HER DISTRESS AND RAN AFTER HER TO SAY NEVER MIND ELSIE I AM EVER SO SORRY FOR YOU AND I DON'T THINK YOU WERE THE LEAST BIT NAUGHTY SHE THANKED HIM WITH A GRATEFUL LOOK THEN HURRIED ON TO HER ROOM WHERE SHE SEATED HERSELF IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND LAYING HER ARMS UPON THE SILL RESTED HER HEAD UPON THEM AND WHILE THE BITTER TEARS FELL FAST FROM HER EYES SHE MURMURED HALF ALOUD AND A FAINT ATTEMPT TO SMILE THROUGH HER TEARS OH WHY AM I ALWAYS SO NAUGHTY ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING TO DISPLEASE MY DEAR PAPA HOW I WISH I COULD BE GOOD AND MAKE HIM LOVE ME I AM AFRAID HE NEVER WILL IF I VEX HIM SO OFTEN THEN AN EARNEST IMPORTUNATE PRAYER FOR HELP TO DO RIGHT AND WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO GAIN HER FATHER'S LOVE WENT UP FROM THE ALMOST DESPAIRING LITTLE HEART TO HIM WHOSE EAR IS EVER OPEN UNTO THE CRY OF HIS SUFFERING CHILDREN AND THUS BETWEEN WEEPING MOURNING AND PRAYING AN HOUR PASSED SLOWLY AWAY AND THE TEA BELL RANG ELSIE STARTED UP BUT SAT DOWN AGAIN FEELING THAT SHE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO WITHOUT HER SUPPER FOR PRESENTLY THERE CAME A MESSENGER BRINGING A PEREMPTORY COMMAND FROM HER FATHER TO COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY TO HER SUPPER YES SIR SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW TREMULOUS TONE VERY WELL THEN REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS TO COME DOWN THE MOMENT THE BELL RINGS UNLESS YOU ARE DIRECTED OTHERWISE OR ARE SICK AND THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE SO LATE I SHALL SEND YOU AWAY WITHOUT YOUR MEAL I DON'T WANT ANY SUPPER PAPA SHE SAID HUMBLY HUSH HE REPLIED SEVERELY I WILL HAVE NO POUTING OR SULKING YOU MUST JUST EAT YOUR SUPPER AND BEHAVE YOURSELF OR I SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THE TABLE AND IF I DO YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY STOP THIS CRYING AT ONCE HE ADDED IN AN UNDERTONE AS HE SPREAD SOME PRESERVES ON A PIECE OF BREAD AND LAID IT ON HER PLATE WHAT IS YOUR HAND TIED UP FOR ELSIE ASKED HER GRANDFATHER HAVE YOU BEEN HURT ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED PAINFULLY BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY HE WATCHED HER A MOMENT WHILE SHE MADE A VIOLENT EFFORT TO CHOKE BACK HER TEARS PAPA TIED IT UP YOU MUST SPEAK WHEN YOU ARE SPOKEN TO SAID HER FATHER ANSWER YOUR GRANDFATHERS QUESTION AT ONCE HER FATHER MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF ABOUT TO LEAD HER FROM THE TABLE O PAPA DON'T SHE CRIED IN TERROR I WILL BE GOOD LET ME HAVE NO MORE CRYING THEN SAID HE THIS IS SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR FOR A GIRL EIGHT YEARS OLD IT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH IN A CHILD OF ENNA'S AGE HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HER EYES NOW SAID HE BEGIN TO EAT YOUR SUPPER AT ONCE AND DON'T LET ME HAVE TO REPROVE YOU AGAIN ELSIE TRIED TO OBEY BUT IT SEEMED VERY DIFFICULT INDEED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WHILE SHE KNEW THAT HER FATHER WAS WATCHING HER CLOSELY AND FELT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS LOOKING AT HER AND THINKING WHAT A NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRL YOU ARE OH THOUGHT THE POOR CHILD IF PAPA WOULD ONLY QUIT LOOKING AT ME MAYBE I COULD KEEP FROM CRYING THEN SHE SENT UP A SILENT PRAYER FOR HELP STRUGGLING HARD TO KEEP BACK THE TEARS AND SOBS THAT WERE ALMOST SUFFOCATING HER AND TAKING UP HER SLICE OF BREAD TRIED TO EAT FOR ADDRESSING A QUESTION TO HER PAPA JUST AT THAT MOMENT THUS TAKING HIS ATTENTION FROM HER AND THEN ADROITLY SETTING THEM ALL TO TALKING UNTIL THE LITTLE GIRL HAD HAD TIME TO RECOVER HER COMPOSURE AT LEAST IN A MEASURE MAY I GO TO MY ROOM NOW PAPA SHE WAS VERY THANKFUL TO HER AUNT ADELAIDE ASKED THE TIMID LITTLE VOICE AS THEY ROSE FROM THE TABLE NO HE SAID TAKING HER HAND AND LEADING HER OUT TO THE VERANDA WHERE HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN AN EASY CHAIR AND LIGHTED A CIGAR BRING ME THAT BOOK THAT LIES YONDER ON THE SETTEE HE COMMANDED SHE BROUGHT IT NOW SAID HE BRING THAT STOOL AND SET YOURSELF DOWN HERE CLOSE AT MY KNEE AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN KEEP YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF FOR AN HOUR OR TWO MAY I GET A BOOK TO READ PAPA SHE ASKED TIMIDLY NO SAID HE SHORTLY YOU MAY JUST DO WHAT I BID YOU AND NOTHING MORE NOR LESS SHE SAT DOWN AS HE DIRECTED WITH HER FACE TURNED TOWARD HIM AND TRIED TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND WATCHING THE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE READ ON AND ON TURNING LEAF AFTER LEAF TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS BOOK TO TAKE ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF HER HOW HANDSOME MY PAPA IS THOUGHT THE LITTLE GIRL GAZING WITH AFFECTIONATE ADMIRATION INTO HIS FACE AND THEN SHE SIGHED AND TEARS TREMBLED IN HER EYES AGAIN SHE ADMIRED HER FATHER AND LOVED HIM OH SO DEARLY AS SHE OFTEN WHISPERED TO HERSELF BUT WOULD SHE EVER MEET WITH ANYTHING LIKE A RETURN OF HER FOND AFFECTION THERE WAS AN ACHING VOID IN HER HEART WHICH NOTHING ELSE COULD FILL MUST IT ALWAYS BE THUS WAS HER CRAVING FOR AFFECTION NEVER TO BE SATISFIED O PAPA MY OWN PAPA WILL YOU NEVER LOVE ME MOURNED THE SAD LITTLE HEART AH IF I COULD ONLY BE GOOD ALWAYS PERHAPS HE WOULD AND THEN IT IS ALL OVER OH I WISH I COULD BE GOOD I WILL TRY VERY VERY HARD AH IF I MIGHT CLIMB ON HIS KNEE NOW AND LAY MY HEAD ON HIS BREAST AND PUT MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND TELL HIM HOW SORRY I AM THAT I HAVE BEEN NAUGHTY AND MADE HIM LOSE HIS BIRD AND HOW MUCH OH HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM BUT I KNOW I NEVER COULD TELL HIM THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT NO WORDS COULD I AM SURE AND IF HE WOULD FORGIVE ME AND KISS ME AND CALL ME HIS DEAR LITTLE DAUGHTER OH WILL HE EVER CALL ME THAT OR IF I MIGHT ONLY STAND BESIDE HIM AND LAY MY HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER AND HE WOULD PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME IT WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY AN EXCLAMATION FROM ENNA CAUSED ELSIE TO TURN HER HEAD AND SUDDENLY SPRINGING TO HER FEET PAPA THERE IS A CARRIAGE COMING UP THE AVENUE IT MUST BE VISITORS PLEASE PLEASE PAPA LET ME GO TO MY ROOM WHY HE ASKED COOLLY LOOKING UP FROM HIS BOOK WHY DO YOU WISH TO GO BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM PAPA SHE SAID HANGING HER HEAD AND BLUSHING DEEPLY I DON'T WANT THEM TO SEE ME YOU ARE NOT

ALL TIMES AND UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES SIT DOWN AND DON'T DARE TO MOVE AGAIN UNTIL I GIVE YOU LEAVE ELSIE SAT DOWN WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD BUT TWO BITTER SCALDING TEARS ROLLED QUICKLY DOWN HER BURNING CHEEKS YOU NEEDN'T CRY ELSIE SAID HER FATHER AND WHO AS HE NEVER NOTICES CHILDREN WILL NOT BE AT ALL LIKELY TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS I HOPE YOU WILL LEARN SOME DAY ELSIE TO SAVE YOUR TEARS UNTIL THERE IS REALLY SOME OCCASION FOR THEM THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD ALIGHTED WHILE MISTER DINSMORE WAS SPEAKING ELSIE SAW THAT HE WAS ALONE AND THE RELIEF WAS SO GREAT THAT FOR ONCE SHE SCARCELY HEEDED HER FATHER'S REBUKE ANOTHER HALF HOUR PASSED AND MISTER DINSMORE STILL SAT READING TAKING NO NOTICE OF ELSIE WHO AFRAID TO SPEAK OR MOVE WAS GROWING VERY WEARY AND SLEEPY SHE LONGED TO LAY HER HEAD ON HER FATHER'S
