and make a stubbly wretched
hey Prima
it was Sabbath morning and LC ready dress for church
the Portico waiting for her father to come down and left her to the carriage
in which I will hide Luisa and Anna were already seated
The Coachman was in his seat
horses a pair of young and fiery Steve purchased by Mr Dinsmore only a few days before
impatiently stamping and tossing their heads
requiring quite an exertion of strength to hold the men
I don't exactly like the actions of those horses Ajax remarks mr. Dinsmore as he came out putting on his glove
I did not intend to have them put in harness today
why did you not give us the Old Bay
Cosmos the horse
okay she's got a lame foot
an old monster he says these youngsters got to be you sometime or another and I reckon I might just as well use them today
do you feel quite sure being able to hold them in ask cuz master
uneasily first of the horse and then it LC
I mastered this year Chow but able to hold it almost anything
when the Negril exhibiting a double row of dazzling white teeth
and besides I just drove Dee's hair horse twice for now and they want splendid
holdeman yes the easiest nothing
selfies and her father still looking a little uneasy in spite of Ajax and boasting
I think it would be just as well for you to stay at home
how to make no reply in words
what are answering looks both such intense disappointment
Ernest entry
well I suppose there is no real danger and since you seem so anxious to go I will not compel you to stay at home
he lifted her into the carriage
fancy and selfie cider
what are The Coachman to drive on as carefully as he could
LC change seats with me
Anna
I want to sit beside brother Horus
no reply the students more laying his hand on his little daughter shoulder
all these places by me and she shall sit nowhere else
do you think we are in any danger being run away with s tattle hide a little anxiously as she observed him glancing once or twice out of the window and was at the same time sensible of their motion was unusually rapid
the horses are young and fiery but Ajax is an excellent driver he replied evasively
adding
you may be sure that if I thought the danger very great I would have left Elsie at home
they reached the church without accident
put on their return the horses took fright while going down a hill and Russia lawn at a furious rate
threatened every instant to upset the carriage
healthy thought they were going very fast but did not know that there was real Danger
until her father suddenly lifted her from her seat
and placing her between his knees held her tightly
as though he feared she would be snatched in his grass
Healthy Look up into his face
it was deadly pale his eyes were fixed upon over an expression of anguish
dear papa she whisper
God will take care of us
I would give all I'm worth to have you safe at home he answered Horsley
I see her closer and closer to him
so even that moment of fearful peril
death seemed just to hand
those words and the affectionate class before Father's arm
send it thrill of intense joyful of famish heart of little girl
what destruction seems inevitable
or was leaning back half painting with Terror
Allied scarcely less alarmed
while I'm a clown to her sobbing most bitterly
LC Lauren preserve a cheerful serenity
she had built her house upon the rock
I knew that it would stand
her Destiny was in her Heavenly father's hands
said she was content to leave it there
even death had no tears to the simple unquestioning faith of little child
I would put her trust in Jesus
but they were not to pair of stuff
for that moment a powerful Nigro who was walking along the road hearing and unusual sound
turn about
cut side of the vehicle coming toward him at such a rapid rate
and instantly comprehended the Peril of the Travellers plant himself in the middle of the road and at the risk of life and limb
cut the horses by the bridal
the sudden unexpected check throwing them upon their haunches and bringing the carriage to an instant standstill
thank God we are saved
that fellow shall be well rewarded for his Brave D explain the students more throwing open the carriage door
that leap into the ground he lifted else the outside her down and gave his hand to his sister's when I do the other
they were almost at the entrance of the Avenue and all preferred to walk the short distance to the house rather than again trust themselves to the horses
mr. Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to the man who had done them such good service
I need to give some directions to The Coachman
I meant taking the hand his little girl who had been waiting for him
he walks slowly on
neither of them speaking the word until they reach the house
when he Stoops and kissed her cheek
asking very kindly if she would recover from a fright
Papa she answered in a quiet town
I knew that God would take care of us
wasn't he good to keep us all from being killed
yes he said very Gravely go now and let Mommy get you ready for dinner
he was sitting alone in her room that afternoon
she was surprised by visit from Laura it being very seldom but the Elder girls care to enter her apartment
Laura looked a little pale
I'm more gray than thoughtful than LC had ever seen her
for a while she sat in silence
instantly burst out
olc I can't help thinking all the time
what if we have been killed
would we all be know where would I have been
I believe you would have gone straight to have an LLC
I oh I should have been with the rich man the minister read about this morning lifting up my eyes and torment
Laura covered her face with her hands and shutter
presently she went on again
I was terribly frightened and so are the rest
Papa Chu LC
tell me do what kept you from being afraid
I was thinking that LC gently turning over the leaves Apollo Bible as she spoke
meet first
yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for that work with me
I know Laura and made me so happy to think the Jesus was there with me
I bet if I were killed
I should only fall asleep to wake up again in his arm
then how could I be afraid
I would give anything to feel as you do so is Laura sign
tell me I'll see
did you not feel afraid for the rest of us
I'm sure you must know that we are not Christians
I don't even pretend to be
healthy blessed and look down
it'll pass so quickly you know Laura
almost at the moment she said
so that I only had time to think of Papa and myself
I prayed so much for him that I felt quite sure God would spare him until he should be prepared to die
was very selfish I know
she had 50 penalty
it was only for a moment I can't tell you how thankful I was for all our spare lives
don't look so is if you had done something very Wicked LLC
glorifying again I'm sure we've given you a little enough reason to care whatever Becomes Of Us
lol see if you can only tell me how to be a Christian
I mean now to try very hard
indeed I'm determined never to rest until I am one
Laura how glad I am cry Delphine joyfully
I know that if you are really in Earnest you will succeed
for no one ever yet fail who try to write
Jesus said
everyone to ask its receive it and he that seeketh findeth
that knock is it shall be opened
is not fat encouraging
listen to what God says here in this verse
you shall seek me and find me
when you shall search for me with all your heart
senior Laura if you will only sleep the Lord with your whole heart
you may be sure quite sure finding him
yes Laura but you have not answered my question
how am I to seek
what means am I to use to get rid of my sins and get a new heart
how to make myself pleasing in the sight of God
what must I do to be saved
that is the very question. Jailer put to Paul and he answered
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved
applied Elsie quickly turning to the chapter and pointing up the text with her finger that Laura might see that she had pulled it correctly
an answer to your other question how shall I get rid of my sins
be here
in that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
10 + for uncleanliness
that isn't Zechariah
when John tells us what that found is
when he says
the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
that again
unto him that loved us
I washed us from our sins in his own blood
yes I'll see but what must I do ask Lori girly
do Laura
only believe replied LC in the same ernestown
Jesus has done and suffered all this necessary
and now we have nothing at all to do but go to him and be washed in that phone
show me the menu says
I give unto them eternal life
just accept the gift
and trust and love him that is the whole of it
and it is so simple that even such a little girls I can understand it
Shirley Elsie I can I must do something
yes God tells us to repent
and he says give me thine heart you can do that
you can love Jesus at least he will enable you to if you ask him
and he will teach you to be sorry for your sins
the Bible says
he is exalted to give repentance and remission of sins
did you ask him
he will give them to you
it is true we cannot do anything good of ourselves
without the help of the Holy Spirit we can do nothing right because we are so very Wicked
then we can always get that help if we ask for it
Jesus said
your heavenly father is more willing to give his holy spirit to them that ask him then parents are to give good gifts to their children
oh Lord don't be afraid to ask for it
don't be afraid to come to Jesus
where he says him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out
and he is such a precious savior
so kind and loving
but remember that you must come very humbly
feeling but you are a great Sinner and not worthy to be heard
and only hoping to be forgiven because Jesus died
the Bible says
God resisteth the proud but gives grace to the humble
Laura linger the greater part of the afternoon in Elsie's room
asking her questions or listening to her
well she read the scriptures
I'll repeat it some beautiful him
sweet childish way
her own peace and joy in believing in Jesus
but it lasts more went to her own room
and Elsa had another quiet half hour to herself
before the t-ball again called the family together
Chelsea answer the summons with a light heart
a heart that thrilled with a new and strange sense of happiness
as she remembered her father's evident anxiety for her
teetering there perilous ride
calling each word and look
Feeling Again in the magic Nation the class with his arm about her waist
Shirley pop it does love me
remember to myself over and over again
I met her at the table with a kind smile
his hand caressingly on her head ass confectionate Tone
why does my little daughter doing this evening
flushed in her eyes grew bright with happiness
and she want to throw her arms around his neck
and tell him how very very much she loved him
but that was quite impossible at the table
and before all the family
so she merely raise so glad eyes to his face and answer
I'm very well thank you Papa
but after all this occurrence produced but little change in Elsie's condition
your father treated her little more affectionately for a day or two
and then gradually return to his ordinary Stern cold Manor
indeed before the week was out
he was again in sad disgrace
she was walking alone in the garden one afternoon
when retention was attracted by a slight fluttering noise
would seem to proceed from Ann Arbor nearby
Adam haseley turning in to ascertain the cause
she found a tiny and beautiful hummingbird
Define under a glass vase
it struggles to escape
it was fluttering and beating against the walls of the prison
reducing the sound little girl had heard in passing
LC was very tender-hearted
I could never see any living creature in distress without feeling a strong desire to relieve his suffering
she knew that Arthur was in the habit of torturing every little insect and bird that came in his way
I said often drawn is persecutions upon herself by interfering in behalf of the poor victim
and now the thought instantly flashed upon her that this was some of his work
that you would return air along to carry out his cool purposes
Bennett wants the rose the desire to released in the prisoner and save it for their suffering
without waiting to reflect the moment she raised the glass and the bird was gone
then she began to think with a little trimmer how angry Arthur would be
but it was too late to think about now
and after all
did not stand in very great drought of the consequences
Ashley as she felt nearly sure of her father's approval of what she had done
having several times hurting reprove Arthur for high school practices
not carry to meet Arthur then however she hastily retreated to the house
what she sees herself in The Veranda with a book
it was a very warm afternoon
and that being on the east side of the house and well protected by trees and Shrubbery and Vines
cuz it's cool spots can be found in the place
Arthur Walter and NF out on the floor playing jackstones
my favorite game with them
and Luis will stretch full length audacity burying the latest novel
she said
is Walter give us a shout and a successful cost and I just made
can you be quiet
mom is taking her afternoon nap and you will disturber
besides I can't read that annoys
healthy wondered why Arthur did not go to see after his bird
but then forgot all about it in the interest with which she was pouring over the story of the Swiss Family Robinson
Jack Stone players for just finishing their game
they're all startled by the sudden appearance of mr. Horace Dinsmore upon the scene
asking a ton of great Wrath
who had been down in the garden and liberated the hummingbird
Hibbett such pains to catch
because it was one of the rare species
he was anxious to add it to his collection of curiosity
terribly frightened
it would have been glad that moment to Think Through the floor
she dropped her book in her lap and clasping her hands over her beating heart
true pale and red by turn
well she think choking with the vain effort to speak and a knowledge herself the culprit
is conscious told her she ought
your father was not looking at her
cuz I was fixed on Arthur
I presume it was you sir he said very angrily
and if so you may prepare yourself radar flying or a return to your prison
or one or the other I'm determined you shall have
I didn't do it any such thing replied the boy fiercely
he will deny it that his brother
we all know that your word is good for nothing
Papa
trembling little voice
Arthur did not do it
it was I
you explain her father in a tone of mingle anger and astonishment as he turned his flashing eye upon her
ulc could it be possible this is your doing
Chelsea's book fell on the floor
and cover your face with both hands she burst into sobs and tear
come here to me this instant he said it's eating himself in the city
how much do Wiis have risen on his entrance
come here and tell me what you mean by medley with my Affairs in this way
please Papa please don't be so very angry with me
the girl I see Rose and came forward and obedience to his command
I didn't know it was your bird
I didn't mean to be naughty
no you never mean to be naughty according to your own account he said
your bad this is all accident
but nevertheless I find you a very Troublesome mischievous child
it was only the other day you broke a valuable vase
he forgot and his anger how little she had really been to blame for that
and now you have caused me the loss of a rare specimen which I had spent a great deal of time and effort and procuring
really I'll see I'm sorely tempted to administer a very severe punishment
healthy coffee arm of the city for support
tell me what you did it for was a pure love of mischief
ask your father sternly taking hold of her arm and holding her up by it
no papa she answered almost under her breath
I was sorry for the little bird
I thought Arthur and put there to torture it
so I let it go I did not mean to do wrong Papa in the I did not
Centier spell faster and faster
indeed
good no business to let who would have put it there which hand did it

stop the child indicating her right hand
you took it in his hand held a moment
my little girl stood trembling Leah waiting what was to come next
we looked at the downcast here for face
wasn't even with Bob
I met a little trembling hand he held
so soft and white and tender
sinisterness was counting his relax somewhat
it seems next to impossible to inflict pain upon anything so tender and helpless
FunForMobile he was half inclined to kiss and forgive her
but no he had been very much irritated it is lost
and the remembrance of it again aroused his anger
and weld like Sting wished little spark of love and compassion
Let It Burn For a Moment his heart
she should be punished
we would not inflict physical pain
BLC laugh Louise maliciously
stealing his pocket rib night I suspect he intends to cut your hand off
Chelsea started in the tearful eyes of rays to her father's face
would look half of terrified entreaty half of confidence that such could not be his intention
hush Louise explain her brother's sternly
you know you are not speaking truly and that I would assume think of cutting off my own hand is my child
you should never speak anything but truth especially to children
I think it's well enough to frighten them a little sometimes and I thought that was what you were going to do
replied Louise
looking somewhat mortified the review
know that her brother that is very bad plan
and one which I shall never adopt
LC will learn in time if she does not know it now
I never addressed right which I do not intend to carry out and never break my word
you draw a handkerchief from his pocket while speaking
I shall try this hand up LC he said proceeding to do so
those who do not use their hands of right must be deprived of the use of them
there let me see if that will keep it out of missed you
Bishop I will pay them put before a long if you continue this mischievous pranks
now go to a room and stay there until pee time
Elsa felt deeply bitterly disgraced and humiliated
has she turned to obey
and it needed not Arthur's triumphant chuckle
nor the smirk of satisfaction antenna space
add to the kingdom suffering for Food and Spirit
like punishment was more to her this if your chest size and it would have been
many another child
the very knowledge of her father's displeasure was enough at any time
to cause great pain through a sensitive spirit and gentle loving heart
Walter who was far more tender-hearted than either his brother or sister
touched by the side of her distress
I'm right after her to say
nevermind I'll see
I'm ever so sorry for you I don't think you were the least bit naughty
gee thanks with a grateful look
attempt to smile through your tears
been hurried onto a room
where she seated herself in a chair by the window
I met her arms up on the Sill
rested her head upon them
all the bitter tears spell fast from her eyes
she murmured half of loud
why am I always so naughty
always doing something to displease my dear pop
how I wish I could be good and make him love me
I'm afraid he never will if 5x and so often
set an Earnest importunate prayer for help to do right
listen to understand how to gain your Father's Love
what up from the almost despairing little heart
to him whose ear is ever opening to The Cry Of The Suffering children
time passed between weeping morning and pray
an hour past slowly away and the T bell rang
healthy started up put that down again
feeling that she would much rather do without her supper
finish over to your school and eyes and tied up and can't able
but she was not to be left her choice matter
presently there came a messenger bringing up from 3 command for her father to come down immediately to her supper
did you not hear the Bell he asked his durastone and she trembling we took her seat at his side
she answered in a low tremulous tone
well that remember that you are always to come down the mall with the bell ring
unless you are directed otherwise or are sick
the next time you were so late I shall send you away without your meal
I don't want any separate Papa
humbly
cuz she replied severely I'll have no pouting or soaking
you must just eat your supper and behave yourself
stop this crying at once he added in an undertone as he spreads and preserves at a piece of bread and laid on her plate
Marshall take you away from the table
and if I do it will be very sorry
you watched her a moment while she made violent effort to choke back or tears
what is your hand tied up for LC ask her grandfather have you been hurt
Elsa's face flush painfully but she made no reply
you must speak when you're spoken to her father answer your grandfather's question at once
appetite it up because I was naughty I tried little girl mainly striving to suppress the Saab
your father made a movement it's about 2 liter from the table
Papa don't she cried and Tara will be good
let me have no more crying then say this is shameful behavior for a girl 8 years old
it would be better nothing at all the age
I took out his handkerchief and wiped her eyes

you going to eat your supper at once and don't let me have to approve you again
tried to obey but it seems very difficult
indeed almost impossible while she knew that her father was watching her closely
but everybody else was looking at her and thinking
what a naughty little girl you are
poor child
pop would only quit looking at me and the rest will forget all about me either suppers
baby I could keep from crying
then she said that the silent prayer for help
struggling hard to keep back the tears and sobs that were almost suffocating her
taking up her slice of bread try to eat
she's very thankful to her aunt Adelaide
more dressy a question to her papa just at that moment
taking his attention from her
and then it's ready setting them all to talking
until the little girl had had time to recover her composure at least in a measure
can I go to my room now Papa
voice of a rose from the table
no he said
taking her hand and leading her out to the veranda
resetting some self in an easy chair and lighted a cigar
bring me that book that lies Yonder on the 50 he commanded
brought it
now City
bring that stool and that yourself down here close at my knee and let me see if I can keep you out of Mischief for an hour or two
can I get a book to me Papa she asks and Italy
know that he shortly
you might just do it I bet you and nothing more nor less
she sat down as he directed with her face turned toward him
try to amuse herself with her own thoughts
and watching the expression of his countenance as he read on and on
Turning Leaf after leaf
too much interest in his book to take any further notice her
how handsome my papa is
the little girl Daisy with affection admiration to his face
and then she sighed
the tears from her eyes again
admire your father and lock Tonneau so dearly
ashiok and Whisper to myself
what would she ever meet with anything like a return of her van defection
it was an aching void in her heart
nothing else could fill busted always be with us
what's your craving for affection never to be satisfied
opap of my own Papa
will you never love me
morbus atom heart
if I could only be good always
perhaps he would
but I'm so often naughty whenever he begins to be kind I'm sure to do something to fix them
I bet it is all over
oh I wish I could be good I will try very very hard
if I might climb on Disney now and lay my head in his breast
I put my arms around his neck
and tell him how sorry I am that I've been naughty and made him lose his bird
and how much oh how much I love him
I know I never could tell him that
I don't know how to express it no words could I'm sure
if you would forgive me and kiss me and call me his dear little daughter
will he ever call me back
or if I might only stand beside him and lay my head on his shoulder
he put his arm around me
it would make me so happy
an exclamation from Anna causality to turn her head
and suddenly spring to her feet
exclaimed and eager excited way
papa there's a carriage coming up the Avenue it must be visitors please please pop it let me go to my room
yes, we looking at my Facebook
why do you wish to go
because I don't want to see them Papa she said Hanging her head and blushing deeply
I don't want them to see me
you are not usually afraid of visitors you replied in the same cool tone
they will say that my hand is tied up
they will ask what is the matter
Papa to please do let me go quickly before they get here
he pleaded in an Agony of Shame and haste
know that he
I shall not to let you go if it were only to punish you for getting off the seat where I made you stay without permission
you will have to learn that I'm to be obeyed at all times and it also could chances
sit down and don't dare to move again until I give you weed
Chelsea sat down without another word
to Bitter scalding tears rolled down her burning cheeks
you didn't cry Elsie said her father
it is only an Old Gentleman who comes to see your grandfather on business
and who as he never notices children will not be at all likely to ask any question
I hope you will learn someday I'll see to save your tears until there is really some occasion for them
the Old Gentleman had a lighted while Mr Dinsmore speaking
Elsie saw that he was alone
the relief was so great that for once she scares me he did her father's rebuke
another half hour past
mr. Dinsmore still sat reading
taking notice of LLC
afraid to speak or move with growing very weary and sleepy
long to lay her head on her father's knee
but they're not venture to take still Liberty
what length she was so completely overpowered by Sleep as to do so unconsciously
the sound of his voice pronouncing her name a roaster
you are tired and sleepy City
if you would like to go to bed you may do so
thank you papa she replied rising to her feet
well he said senior hesitate

I'm very sorry I was not a papa will you please forgive me
the words were spoken very low and almost for the Saab

yes can a cold grave tone
yes sir I will try to be a good girl always
The Humble little boy
then I will forgive you he replied to taking the handkerchief off your hand

she felt as if she could not go without something token of forgiveness and love
light cameras
he looked at her with an impatient well
then answer term you request
