my fellow American
this week prosecutors
Law Enforcement Officers Homeland Security official
hello Americans join me at the White House to address
a very vicious thread
to our community
The Savage gang MS
13
blaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country
for example
under current law unaccompanied alien minors at the border
our release
into American communities no matter where
no matter how
it's so easy for them because the laws are bad
and they have
to be chained
this loophole is easily exploited by MS-13
which now operates in at least
40 state

in addition to MSN

many other gangs are breaking into our country routinely
because I lost the show
so sad



at this week's Roundtable we learned the story of one family right here in Washington DC
that hosted a person in their home
who then began to
young son
2ms
13
when the boy's mother tried to stop
the gang member shot her in the head
blinding her for life
she's lucky she live

paying a very big
price
during my state of the union I called on Congress to immediately close dangerous loopholes in federal law
that have endangered our community
and imposed enormous burdens on US 10

my Administration has identified
three major priorities
for creating a safe
modern
add a lawful immigration system
Felicia Curry the Border
ending chain migration
and canceling
the Visa Lottery
chain migration is a disaster
and very unfair to our country
the Visa Lottery is something that should have never
been allowed in the first
play
people enter a lottery
to come into our country
what kind of a system is that
it is time for Congress to act

tecta America
every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement
and decide
of the American people
that's the way it has to be
thank you
