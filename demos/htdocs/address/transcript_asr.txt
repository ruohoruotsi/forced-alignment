my fellow Americans
this week prosecutors law enforcement offices Homeland Security officials
lawmakers join me at the White House to address
a very vicious threat to our communities
The Savage gang MS-13
glaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country
for example
under current law unaccompanied alien minors at the border
are released into American communities no matter where
no matter how
so easy for them because the laws are bad and they have to be changed
this loophole is easily exploited by MS-13
which now operates in at least 40 States
in addition to MS-13
many other gangs are breaking into our country routinely
because I lost the show week
so sad

at this week's Roundtable we learned the story of one family right here in Washington DC
that hosted a person in their home
who then began to recruit their young son
do MS-13
when the boy's mother tried to stop it the gang member shot her in the head
blinding her for life
she's lucky she lived but she's paying a very big price
during my state of the union I called on Congress to immediately close dangerous loopholes in federal law
that have endangered our communities
an imposed enormous burdens on us taxpayers
my Administration has identified three major priorities
creating a safe
modern and lawful immigration system fully security the Border
ending chain migration
I'm cancelling the Visa Lottery
chain migration is a disaster and very unfair to our country
the Visa Lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place
people enter a lottery to come into our country
what kind of a system is that
is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans
every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement
by the side of the American people
that's the way it has to be
